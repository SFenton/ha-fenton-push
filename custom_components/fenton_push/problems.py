"""Problem cards (spec section 5): the code table, the wording, the raw-text fallbacks and the problem records.

Wording lives here so that new wording ships with a relay update and never needs an app release. Everything in this
module is pure (no Home Assistant): ``build_problem`` turns a code into the card's ``ProblemInfo`` and
``ProblemRecord`` is the engine's bookkeeping for one open problem (its Donetick task and the fallback push).
